<h2>What have I learnt from these oneline tests?</h2>

<p>
I have learnt that my personality type is INFP-T. This personaility type is apparently quite rare, accounting for only 4% of the population.
INFP-T's are introverted and sometimes can come accross as being shy and reserved. The INFP-T personaility type is generally consistent with being optimistic,
always looking for ways for improvement and making decisions based on prinicpals rather than logic.
According to a Big Five Personaility Test I also completed, I am quite well-organised and reliable, and can find it easy to express irritation with others.

</p>

<p>
Optimisim and always striving for continual improvement could work well for me and others in a team environment. Being introverted, I may sometimes struggle to convey
my thoughts or intentions clearly to other team members who may be outgoing/extraverted. I could take this in to account when searching for a team by teaming up with other people with
introverted personality types, who I also share common interests and goals with.
