    <h3><b>What got you interested in IT?</b></h3>
<p>My interest in IT started at my current place of work. My role involves a lot of analytical work/reporting
   using excel. A colleague of mine who works in our IT department introduced me to VBA. I was amazed
   that he was able to automate a task that would normally take me hours. From this I began taking online
   courses through Coursera and Udemy, learning the basics of various languages. The courses I have done
   so far have been in VBA, SQL, Python, HTML and CSS.</p>

<br>

<h3><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></h3>
<p>I chose to study a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT because I would like to transition
   in to an IT/tech related field in the near future. At the moment I have my eyes set on data analysis or
   database admin, however I expect my understanding and preference of fields to change as I am exposed
   to different aspects of IT throughout my degree with RMIT.</p>

<br>
   <h3><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></h3>
   <p>I hope to learn more about different programming languages and to also discover other aspects of the
      IT industry that I may not already know about.</p>
