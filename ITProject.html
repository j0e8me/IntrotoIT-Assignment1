<p>
EasyStrata is a platform that is marketed toward Strata Management Companies.
The project aims to provide a centralised platform for Strata Managers to store information on the buildings
 within their portfolios, improve communication with owners of the apartments, as well as to streamline the way
  access to the common property is provided for service providers (Utilities Meter Readers, garbage disposal, cleaners,
   etc.) EasyStrata will operate as a web-based application, as well as having an application on both iOS and Android operating systems.
</p>

<p>
Data has shown that the rate of residential apartment building construction has risen over recent years. In the years 2003 to 2004,
 residential apartment buildings made up 18.2% of all dwelling types. According to data for years 2017 to 2018, apartments share of total
  dwelling type rose by 67%, now accounting for 30.4% of dwelling types. As our capital cities continue to grow, more of the population opt
   toward apartment living as it provides a cheap option to live within close proximity to major employment hubs. With high-density construction
    growth, the demand for Strata Management services will grow with it.
</p>

<p>
The motivation behind this project is to provide an efficient and easy to use system for Strata managers to manage their portfolios. In addition to this,
 EasyStrata also streamlines the way access to common property is provided to service providers. Some service providers require access to communal areas
  of residential apartments daily. Service providers may include Meter Readers, Garbage Disposal, Cleaners, etc.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, service providers are either assigned multiple keys/swipe cards for buildings or are expected to pick up and return keys when they require access.
 Assigning a physical set of keys to a service provider can be insecure; the keys may become lost or stolen, or the key may be passed on to an unknown party and
  used inappropriately. It can also become a logistical challenge for service providers managing keys for 100+ sites. Service providers can also find it particularly
   challenging to manage access if multiple staff members require access to a particular building, as Strata Management companies generally only issue one set of keys
    to a Service Provider. The reason for this is mainly to do with the cost of cutting keys and the added risk that comes with creating additional sets of keys that
     can either be lost or stolen. EasyStrata's solution to this problem reduces foot traffic in strata management offices, allows service providers to more efficiently
      complete their days work, and improves building security by keeping a log of who has entered the building.
</p>

<p>
  The platform will have three main functions:</p>
<li>An information management system for Strata Managers to keep meticulous records and manage their portfolios.</li>
<li>A form of communication between owners and the Strata Manager.</li>
<li>An access management system to common property for registered service providers.</li>




<p>
Each Strata company that signs up will have their own EasyStrata account, which they can then create accounts for their employees. Strata Management company staff can then
 create profiles for each of the buildings in their portfolio. Within each building profile, the Strata Manager may keep relevant documents saved, including insurance policies,
  maintenance records, meeting minutes, budgets, etc. Users with a Strata Manager account can create re-occurring or one-off reminders, with the option to include other individuals
   or groups (E.g., invite all owners of Building X to up-coming owners corporation meeting). These reminders appear in a calendar within the platform and allow the Strata Manager
    to display their calendar with upcoming appointments/actions colour-coded by building.
</p>

<p>
The platform also serves as a form of communication between owners and Strata Management, allowing owners to view notices or upcoming meetings posted by their Strata Manager.
 The platform is ring-fenced, so that apartment owners have access to content relevant to their building only. Owners may also submit a report via the EasyStrata application
  regarding damage or faults with the building or common property, a complaint, or a suggestion for improvement. The report function supports photographic and video attachments,
   which can streamline insurance claims, requests for maintenance etc. Once a report is submitted, a ticket is created, and the Strata Manager is notified. The Strata Manager can
    then easily monitor, assign tasks to others in their organisation, or attach an action/reminder to their calendar relevant to the ticket.
</p>

<p>

  EasyStrata will also develop an access management system that uses NFC technology to manage access to common property areas for Service providers. Service providers would be
   required to have a mobile phone with NFC capability and would be required to register with the Strata Management company that manages the building they require access to.
     Service providers access is configured in the EasyStrata application and access can be configured to allow access to any building that is a part of the EasyStrata network,
      regardless whether the sites are managed by the same Strata Management company. When access is attempted, the action is logged and kept on record.
</p>

<p>

  EasyStrata will be a cloud-based application, using PostgreSQL to store and manage data. The website will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The iOS application will
   be developed with the swift language, the android application with Kotlin. The locking mechanism will use NFC technology to authenticate requests for access to common property
    areas of the buildings by registered service providers.
</p>

<p>

  The project will require an experienced developer team with members having experience in front/back end web development, iOS/swift development, and Android/Kotlin development.
   A Database Administrator will also be required to manage queries and maintenance of the PostgreSQL database.
</p>

<p>
On successful completion of the project, EasyStrata will provide a service that is attractive to large and small Strata Management Companies, also bringing added benefit to the
 owners of the apartment complexes and companies that provide regular services to the buildings. It has the potential to allow Strata companies to grow their portfolios while
  keeping admin costs down, as well as streamlining how access to common property areas is managed between Strata Management companies and service providers.
