    This advertisement is for a Data Analyst and the duties include designing and creating reports for other users within the ICT
     services unit as well as performing data analysis to develop insights and identify potential improvements. The role
      is particularly interesting to me as in my current role I am often required to design and build KPI performance reports/dashboards
       in Microsoft Excel which I thoroughly enjoy doing. I like the idea of turning a set of data in to a useful report/visualization that tells
       a story and produces insights.

    </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    There are no specific skills mentioned in the advertisement, however the role of a Data Analyst usually requires skills using Microsoft Excel/VBA,
     SQL query language and possibly a scripting language such as Python. Public speaking skills would also be benficial as data analysts may be required to present
    their findings to collegues or clients.
  </p>
<p class="maintext">
  I consider myself to be proficient in Microsoft Excel, and have a basic knowledge in VBA. I am able to write basic scripts in VBA to perform automation
   in spreadsheets. When I require something more advanced, I am usually able to find something similar on the internet and then edit it to fit my purpose.
    For example, at work I receive 15 emails daily, each with an attachment I must save to my computer. I found a VBA script online which performed a similar task.
     I was able to edit the script to fit my needs and saved myself 5-10 minutes.

      I have also completed some basic online courses in SQL and Python languages.

</p>
<p class="maintext">
  My plan to transition in to a Data Analyst role is to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT as well as some short courses relevant to data analysis
   along the way (Udemy, Coursera etc.)
   Continuing to incorporate the skills I have already acquired in to my current job will also put me in good stead, as it will give me an opportunity to practice and
    build on my skills.
